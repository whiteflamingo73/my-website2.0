            <p>This is a short story I wrote about myself in 7th grade </p>

        <p>Pain, Pain and more Pain! Just earlier I was working on my bed,
            putting bed sheets and pillows on the bed. I have a loft so I was under
            my bed pulling over the bed sheet on a particularly hard spot to reach.
            I was looking directly up. That’s when the pain hit. An unimaginable
            amount of agony in my right eye. I couldn’t bear it. At that moment I
            was barely thinking, so during this confusion of sorts I rushed to
            the sink in the bathroom. Forcing my eye open, I was looking at my
            blurry self and I realized that my eye was bloodshot!
            As my parents were getting ready for bed, filling up their sleep aps with the clear
            distilled water, I rushed to my parents to show them my eye. When they saw my eye
            they started freaking out! My dad told me to get a stream of water under my eye,
            so we could get that thing out of my eye(which we speculated was a piece of dust
            or dirt). So I went downstairs to the sink in the kitchen to wash out my eye,
            but even still there was Pain, Pain and more Pain! After a minute or two of
            freaking out my dad ended up taking me to the hospital because it seemed like
            it was more than just a piece of dust in my eye.
            Fifteen minutes, that’s about the amount of time it takes to get to the hospital
            from my house. By the time we got in the car the pain had died down but it still
            hurt pretty badly. My eyes were extremely watery making my vision blurry from
            all the tears. Then we finally got to the parking lot, after what felt like
            an eternity…
            We walked into the building to the front desk. My dad talked to the receptionist
            about what was going on, and filled out the usual paperwork stuff. Furthermore
            we were instructed to wait and sit in the chairs like what generally happens. We
            were waiting for hours! It was probably until 1:30 when we were called in
            (and for reference we headed out the house around 11:10 p.m). When we entered
            the small little room you could hear all the noise and rush from the nurses and
            patients outside. The room was small with an exam table on the right and a
            couple chairs to the left. The doctor asked what was going on and stuff and
            what happened and we told him about the whole incident, so he left the small
            little room to get a nurse to help us. It was a long while before the next
            doctor came in.
            Once the nurse came in they had this weird thin pellet stick thingy, about
            the size of the tip of your pinky finger nail. Apparently this thing would glow
            in UV light and they were going to put it in my eye! All of this was just to
            make sure I didn’t scratch my retina, which by the way could cause permanent
            damage!
            Once this pellet thingy was dropped into my eye. The doctor shined the UV light into
            my eye. Now within about five seconds I felt the pain from the piece of dust, the
            pellet thingy entering my eye and my vision turning purple from the UV light,
            and my pupil contracting from the shining light, all of this combined was making
            my eyes water.
            After the nurse checked my eye they said that my retina was fine and they couldn’t
            really do anything, so they just gave us some eye drops to numb the pain and sent us
            off. As we were heading out my dad asked the nurse that helped us if this was an
            overreaction and they said that “It was but if that happened to me or someone I
            knew I would’ve brought them here.”
            We walked slowly into the car and thought about how they may have scammed us for
            that little amount of time we needed help and the one thing they gave us. Once we
            got driving it only took us about 15 minutes and by the time we got home it was
            around three or four a.m in the morning and we told my mom that it went well.
            And we got ready for bed once again.
