This is the website I'm working on in my programming 2 class, it's going to end up having all my assignments I will have to do for this class.
I will end up forking this once the class is over with, I will get rid of the "bloat" and make it more confined to what I want it to be, instead of
just assignments for learning html, css, and javascript.
